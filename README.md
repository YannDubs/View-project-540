# miRNAseq Analysis

This project will analyze single-cell miRNA sequencing data from HL-60 cells— a promyeloblast cell-line which is commonly used as a differentiation model— along a 7-day time-course of ATRA treatment. The overall objective is to utilize next-generation sequencing data to investigate the role of miRNA in ATRA-induced differentiation. The hypothesis is that the HL-60 miRNA expression signatures will change as the cells differentiate relative to time.
